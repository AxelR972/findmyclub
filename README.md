# Getting Started with Vite + React

This project was bootstrapped with Vite (https://vitejs.dev/) and React.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm run dev`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `dist` folder.\
It bundles and optimizes the code for best performance.

The build is minified, and filenames include hashes.
Your app is ready to be deployed.

### `npm run preview`

Serves the production build locally so you can test it before deploying.

## Learn More

You can learn more in the [Vite documentation](https://vitejs.dev/).

To learn React, check out the [React documentation](https://reactjs.org/).

### Notes

Environment variables in Vite must start with VITE_.
Example: VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:5000

Vite is much faster than Create React App and provides instant HMR (Hot Module Replacement).

If you are using TailwindCSS, it works out of the box with Vite.
